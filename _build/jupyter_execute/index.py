# ## About me
# 
# I enjoy solving puzzles, uncovering patterns and working with IT systems. This has led me to studying, and soon to be working in the field of cyber security analysis. I'm always looking for more data to help uncover trends and gain knowledge about my environment so that I can help protect it.
# 
# I'm also an avid amateur sysadmin with my own homelab where I self host a number of services used by friends and family.
# 
# While you're here, stop and have a look at some of my [blog](Blog/Blog) posts.
