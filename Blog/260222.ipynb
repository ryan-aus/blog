    "My homelab is connected to the internet with a 20mb/s down and 5mb/s up connection, just enough for a remote 720p stream at decent quality without completely saturating the link. The problem is that the [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse) app I use will not request my [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) server to transcode the video. So if I play a 4K video file on Infuse, my 5mb/s upload speed can't keep up."

    "Ok, my media files are beginning to be converted and then saved into a temp directory I created to hold them. From there I'll write a python script which reads the names of the files, parses them to get their series name and the season number. With the series name and the series number the script will create directories in the 720p directory so it would be structured like `720pShows/[Series]/[Season]/[Episode]` and then the files will be moved.\n",

    "I _assumed_ Tdarr would place the converted video file into the temp directory as I had set it to. Makes sense right? I copied some video files into the temp directory to test it - and it worked! I set up a systemd timer to run my script every minute so that as newly converted files are placed into the temp directory they are moved into their new home.\n",
